📱 Qhiwa App
Qhiwa is a simple Flutter-based mobile app designed to streamline coffee runs among friends or teammates. Instead of asking everyone individually how they take their coffee, users can create an account, log in, and update their preferences directly in the app.

☕ Features
🔐 User Authentication: Register and sign in using email and password.

👤 User Preferences:

Set the number of sugar cubes.

Choose coffee strength via a slider.

Update display name at any time.

🔄 Real-time Updates: When a user changes their preferences, the updates are visible to everyone using the app.

👥 Team View: View all users and their coffee preferences in a clean, card-based layout.

💡 Use Case
Imagine a friend is going out to grab coffee. Instead of asking every person one by one, they simply check the Qhiwa app to see each person's current preferences — making the process quicker and more efficient!
